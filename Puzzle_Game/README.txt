The puzzle works in itself but here are improvement that need to be done :

///////////////////// to the puzzle itself /////////////////////
1 - The scaling must operate on any image larger or smaller
-> the image is scaling the problem is coming from my pieces, I use the image at first, but instead of getting my info from callback I should be doing it from a promise in a global variable to get the the new img size


2 - The shuffle must be really random, that is to say, link each pieces to the puzzled image drawn
-> Pieces are now  randomly shuffling and also scaling

2.5 => Touch movements for mobile

///////////////////// to the organization / global improvements /////////////////////
3 - Add a carrousel to the  site on the right in order to choose pre-chosen pictures / add yours

4 - gallery of succesfully ended puzzle ?
