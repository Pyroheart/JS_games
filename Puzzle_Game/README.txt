The puzzle works in itself but here are improvement that need to be done :

///////////////////// to the puzzle itself /////////////////////
1 - The scaling must operate on any image larger or smaller

2 - The shuffle must be really random, that is to say, link each pieces to the puzzled image drawn


///////////////////// to the organization / global improvements /////////////////////
3 - Add a carrousel to the  site on the right in order to choose pre-chosen pictures / add yours

4 - gallery of succesfully ended puzzle ?
